Fully configurable Z-Wave to MQTT gateway and control panel.

![Z-Wave to MQTT](zwave2mqtt/logo.png)

## About

The Z-Wave to MQTT add-on allows you to decouple your Z-Wave network from
your Home Assistant instance by leveraging your MQTT broker. It ships with
a web-based control panel, allowing you to configure every aspect of your
Z-Wave network and how they are published in MQTT.

Some advantages and use-cases for this are:

- Your Z-Wave network will keep running between Home Assistant restarts.
- You can directly use things like Node-RED with your Z-Wave network, while
  it is available for Home Assistant at the same time.
- Allow [ESPHome.io][esphome] based ESP devices to directly respond or work
  with your Z-Wave network.

This add-on uses the [Zwave2Mqtt][zwave2mqtt] software provided by OpenZWave.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Z-Wave to MQTT" add-on.
1. Start the "Z-Wave to MQTT" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Z-Wave to MQTT" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button.
1. Enjoy the add-on!

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

**NOTE**: The upstream project has documentation on using the software itself:
<https://github.com/OpenZWave/Zwave2Mqtt>

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "ssl": true,
  "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
  "keyfile": "privkey.pem"
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL on the control panel. Set it `true` to enable it,
`false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is default for Hass.io._

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is default for Hass.io._

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication on the add-on by setting it to `true` and leaving the
username and password empty.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

## Embedding into Home Assistant

It is possible to embed the Z-Wave to MQTT control panel web interface directly
into Home Assistant, allowing you to access it through the Home Assistant
frontend.

Home Assistant provides the `panel_iframe` integration, for these purposes.

Example configuration:

```yaml
panel_iframe:
  zwave2mqtt:
    title: Z-Wave to MQTT
    icon: mdi:z-wave
    url: http://addres.to.your.hass.io:8091
```

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on is currently unable to support Hass.io Ingress. This is due to
  technical limitations of the zwave2mqtt control panel web interface.

## Changelog & Releases
